screensaver for macos

i'm a big fan of the (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfdDTv07Nhw)[deco screensaver from the ancient xscreensaver collection], but always wished it could be segmented into parts that aren't rectangles. so i made it!

written in 2021, compiled as screensaver bundle and pushed in 2025.

## to-do:
[ ] change random color algo to choose colors more similarly to the original deco screensaver. current code favors darker, cooler, and more desaturated shades more than i would prefer (?).

## license

not being greedy i swear. i'm not particularly protective of this code in particular i'm just too lazy to pick one of those free use sort of licenses right now. go crazy with this repo honestly
